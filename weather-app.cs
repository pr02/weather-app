/*
For this can you I ask you to create your own program in Python, JavaScript or .NET that uses https://www.weatherapi.com/ to get the weather of all major airports
in New Zealand (you decide which ones are major). Please do not use a SDK and make sure you comment your code to show the process you went through.

Program should at least print out:
路        Airport Name and Region
路        Temperature in Celsius
路        The Weather Condition
路        Wind in kph

You could go further if you wish and look at creating a nice GUI or webpage for this info, but printing it out to screen is fine.
Commit your code to a new GitHub repository (If you don't already have a GitHub account, create one) 
Email me back a link to the GitHub repository.

Any question about this please email me back. If you could have something back by Friday the 25th that would be great.

                Despite my efforts, I could not get the Json class to Deserialize the call from the API without spitting out all
                kinds of errors. This was rather unfortunate as it means that I can only get the output in its raw form. If I had
                a little more time I surely would have had it going though.

                The other file airport.cs contains the JSON property values that I was intending to pull from the response if it actually
                gave me what I wanted.
